# README #

A planning library containing various sampling based planners. This is an extension of the original ompl from Kavraki lab.

# Warning #
Please do not modify without discussing with maintainer. We are striving to preserve it so that it can be updated from original package.

# TODO #

The coding style does not follow our standards unfortunately - discussion with Daniel Althoff resulted in the decision to not touch ompl and live with this.

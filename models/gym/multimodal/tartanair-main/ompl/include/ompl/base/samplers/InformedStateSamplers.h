        It focuses the search to the subset of a problem that can improve a current solution, which is a prolate hyperspheroid (PHS)
        (a special type of an hyperellipsoid) and can be sampled directly.
        Doing so considers all homotopy classes that can provide a better solution while guaranteeing a non-zero probability
        of improving a solution regardless of the size of the planning domain, the number of state dimensions, and how close
        the current solution is to the theoretical minimum.
        Currently only implemented for problems with a single goal in R^n (i.e., RealVectorStateSpace), SE(2) (i.e., SE2StateSpace), and SE(3) (i.e., SE3StateSpace).
        Until an initial solution is found, this sampler simply passes-through to a uniform distribution over the entire state space.
